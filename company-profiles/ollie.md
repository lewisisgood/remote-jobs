## Company blurb

Ollie Pets is a subscription pet food company with a mission to empower customers to feed their dogs the healthiest fresh food on the market.

Our product allows customers to enter their dogs' information—weight, allergies, activity level—to calculate the right amount of food for your dog to keep them in tip-top shape.

On our account page after signup, you can fine-tune every part of your subscription—which recipes you get, how often you get them, and even how much of your dog's meals you want to be Ollie.
