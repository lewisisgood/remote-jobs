# Reducer

## Company blurb

Reducer simplifies business price comparison down to a single click.

Traditional price comparison sites don't work, because customers have to find their bills and enter lots of data into web forms. Reducer works differently. We integrate with your cloud accounting platform and analyse the data there. This means we can find your business savings across 8 different spend areas in just one click.
