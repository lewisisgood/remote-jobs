# Upwork Pro

## Company blurb

The Upwork story begins over two decades ago when the tech lead of a Silicon Valley startup realized his close friend in Athens would be perfect for a web project. The team agreed he was the best choice, but were concerned about working with someone halfway around the globe.

In response, the two friends created a new web-based platform that brought visibility and trust to remote work. It was so successful the two realized other businesses would also benefit from reliable access to a larger pool of proven talent, while workers would enjoy freedom and flexibility to find jobs online. Together they decided to start a company that would deliver on the promise of this technology. Fast-forward to today, that technology is the foundation of Upwork â€” the leading flexible talent solution. With millions of jobs posted on Upwork annually, independent professionals are earning money by providing companies with over 5,000 skills across more than 70 categories of work.

Upwork Pro is an exclusive group that gives the best freelance professionals access to clients and projects not accessible to the entire marketplace. Qualifying freelancers will receive an invitation to join the group.
