## Company blurb

IPInfo is the team behind the popular [IP Intelligence API](https://ipinfo.io) used by more than 100,000+ businesses and developers, handling 40B+ requests/month.

Since then, we have grown to create our own geolocation data-set (not relying on [MaxMind](https://www.maxmind.com/)), identifying bots, carrier information, companies, and ASNs.
