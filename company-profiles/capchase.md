# Capchase

## Company blurb

Capchase is an early-stage startup aiming to radically transform how SaaS companies fund their growth by allowing them to receive upfront cash for contracts they sign with customers.

Capchase pays the SaaS companies the full annual license price minus a fee upfront, and then collects the monthly installments from the IT buyers for the full price of the license. As a result, the SaaS companies can use their own future sales to fund their own growth, and increase their runway. It's a no-brainer!
