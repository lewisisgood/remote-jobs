# Skyrocket Ventures

## Company blurb

Skyrocket Ventures is a leading recruiting firm for high growth technology companies that range from industry leaders to top-tier startups. They aim to bring the best companies and candidates together. 

Why Employers Work With Us
Companies we work with consistently pull ahead of the competition. Even in the face of challenges such as aggressive competitors, a difficult economy, and industry volatility, companies we work with are much more likely than others to reach their goals, whether they be increasing shareholder value, market share, going public, or getting acquired.

Why Candidates Work With Us
Most recruiting firms only try to fill jobs, whereas Skyrocket Ventures also places candidates. Thereâ€™s a subtle difference between the two. So if one of our recruiters is in touch with you, we will want to get to know you and understand both your short-term and long-term goals, so that we can accelerate your career advancement.
